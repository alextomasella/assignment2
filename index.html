            <p class = "lead text-center">According to NASM, personal training is a service where a professional provides 
                individuals with information, motivation, and guidance to improve health and 
                meet fitness goals!</p>
            <p class = "text-center text-secondary">Personal training is much more then just having a workout partner. It is having
                a profession who is educated in health and fitness to help you reach your goals.
                The personal trainers have gotten their certifications through NASM and other resources
                just as respected. </p>

            <!--new section for why personal training interests me-->
            <h2 class = "subheader text-center mb-3 text-primary">Why Personal Training Interests Me!</h2>
            <p class = "text-center text-secondary">Ever since I was young, I have always been active, whether that be through playing baseball,
                basketball, soccer, or going to the gym. Being active and going to the gym has helped me a bunch.
                Not just with sports, there are a ton of mental benefits as well. I have experienced this for myself!
                I have been working out seriously for about 4 years now and have learned a lot through the process.
                I wanted to give people the same benefits I have experienced through fitness, so over the summer, I decided
                to get my personal training certification through NASM. I am super passionate about fitness and helping
                others, so I thought this would be a great way to combine the two!
