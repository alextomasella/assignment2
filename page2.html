            <h2>Types of Personal Training</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>One-on-One Training</li>
                    <li>Group Training</li>
                    <li>Online Training</li>
                    <li>Specialized Training</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each type of training has its own benefits and one style is not a cookie cutter solution.
                    If you want to get some friends and be social, group training might be your thing! If you are crunched for
                    time, online training might be the best fit.</p>
